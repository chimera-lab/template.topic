- Monitor documentation coverage and quality.
- Facilitate agent team coordination.

## :toolbox: Tools

### :toolbox: `cmr` CLI

The CMR CLI (`cmr`) automates chimera-lab repositories managing documentation validation, milestones, issues, labels, and git operations for submodules and templates. It unifies discovery, GitHub resources, and template workflows.

### :toolbox: `gh` CLI

Used for issue discovery and context extraction. Before any planning, discover and read issues using `gh` CLI to provide full context.
